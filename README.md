# user_registration_api
 An API created using FastAPI for registration with basic user authentication. With endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting users. Extras: Integrated with an SQLite database to store data.

# First steps!
First I created the project folder using the commands: 
mkdir fastapi_crud_auth
cd fastapi_crud_auth

Then I created a virtual environment, this is optional but recommended, for this I used:
python -m venv venv

And finally I installed the dependencies:
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy passlib

# Second step: Creating the project structure!
